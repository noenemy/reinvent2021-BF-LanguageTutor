1. Project Overview

Language Tutor using AWS AI/ML

2. Project Description

This project is an 1:1 tutor service for multi-language using AWS AI/ML services. Students will interact with a VR tutor implemented by Amazon Sumerian. In particular, we want to make it easy for kids and preschoolers to learn multi-language through casual games. So we believe AWS AI/ML services and Amazon Sumerianâ€™s VR effect would be the perfect technologies for our users to learn to read, write, listen and speak a foreign language.

3. Attendee Experience 

The project will provide various types of education method for our users to learn a new language. Through interaction with the Sumerian tutor in the VR classroom, attendees can learn the language naturally through various activities including listen, repeat or draw cards with words and pictures within the time limit. This will be used for kids and preschoolers to learn their mother language and also for users who want to learn a foreign language.

The demo leverages Amazon Rekognition, Amazon Transcribe, Amazon Textract, Amazon Polly, Amazon Sumerian, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon ECS and Amazon ElastiCache and so on. Project source code is automatically deployed as frontend and backend by AWS Code Pipeline.
